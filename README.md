# Black Hole

This is a CTF problem for NTU CSIE Freshman ICPC 2024. Feel free to try it!

## Problem Description

<img src="https://github.com/HyperSoWeak/blackhole/blob/main/blackhole.jpg?raw=true" width="100%" alt="A cute black hole">

As you stare into the depths of the black hole, you feel an unusual pull—a strange attraction that draws you closer. No matter how near you get, the black hole seems to protect something, shrouded in mystery. As you carefully observe the edges of the black hole, you notice something odd, a subtle clue that hints at a hidden message waiting to be uncovered.

For those brave enough to venture into its depths, the first hint is subtle: The image’s mass feels too large for what it should be, and something within is compressed, obscured from direct view. But black holes distort more than just light—files, too, can be hidden in their grasp.

## Hints

- Every flag should follow the format `CSIE{[0-9A-Za-z-_]+}`.
- The black hole's mass is immense. Is it possible that it's not what it seems? Maybe you should check the file's type for further clues.
- There are 5 flags.
- 垃圾箱行走.
